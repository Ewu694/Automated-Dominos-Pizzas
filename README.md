# Domino's Free Pizza Bot <br>
This python script takes advantage of Dominos emergency pizza student program to automate the generation of codes for free pizzas to save both time and money. Feel free to alter the libraries/code to better suit your needs <br>

## Libraries and corresponding Modules Used:
- **undetected_chromedriver:** Script is to be ran on google chrome using the library undetected_chromedriver to avoid detection by websites that use mechanisms to identify and block automated browsing
- **selenium.webdriver.common.by:** Takes advantage of the By class in the Selenium library to locate elements on a webpage
- **selenium.webdriver.support.ui.WebDriverWait:** Used as a wait condition to optimally deal with loading
- **selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions as EC:** Used to specify what to wait for within the script
- **Faker:** Used to generate a fake name each time when running script

## Dependencies:
